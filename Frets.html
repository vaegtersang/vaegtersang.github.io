<h4>General</h4>
<p class='noindent'>Here is background context I already know is not directly communicated; I think some of it’s inferrable, but if it’s not I’m OK with these being points of modest confusion so long as that confusion isn’t damaging interest/ability to enjoy the story. Most of this is already planned to be better communicated in subsequent chapters, so the question on these is do any of these facts need to be more directly incorporated in to Ch. 1.</p>
<ul>
    <li>It’s several years after the canonical events of the game. Irene is nearing the end of her apprenticeship (Technically communicated at the very end, but do I need to bring it further toward the front?)</li>
    <li>Link’s been out on several more adventures since, which I think is inferrable from the passing mention of Labrynna.</li>
    <li>Definitely not covered: Most of those adventures are almost diplomatic favors to neighboring countries. Nothing so giant as the canonical ALBW adventure, just frequent &ldquo;Oh monster infestation, we can send Link over&rdquo;s.</li>
    <li>Definitely not covered, probably inferrable, don’t think it’s a big deal if not?: This is set in the Castle, to which his frequent royal service gives Link access.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Irene</h4>
<ul>
    <li>There are sound logistical reasons Link’s troubles take center stage in this first chapter &ndash; but I’m trying to figure out how heavy-handed I’m going to need to be in subsequent chapters to communicate Irene’s own problems. They’re mentioned obliquely in a few places this chapter, and I’m wondering if I can more effectively preview Irene’s issues here instead of waiting a chapter to get into them. She has two variations of the same problem:<ol>
        <li>She wants to be famous for being an accomplished witch; and worries that her public perception now is forever set as &ldquo; one of the <a href="./ALBW-Primer.html">sages</a>&rdquo;, with attention drawn away from skills that feel more her own to skills that feel like some sort of cosmic accident.</li>
        <li>The same fear of being swallowed up by mythic history problematizes her friendship with Link, who is &ndash; against his will &ndash; the locus of a whole lot more mythologizing, and so just about any association with him leads back to problem variant (1). But there’s also a more specific  trap lurking here, which is that there’s a long list of past sages in previous games with unrequited feelings for their respective Link. 
        Irene, justifiably, is worried that the public has shipping goggles on and it’s coloring a ton of her daily interactions and making them profoundly weird. Worse, the goggles are at least half-accurate; she absolutely does have feelings, though she is the least self-aware chacter I’ve ever written and I doubt she knows it. Somewhere in her subconscious though is a secondary conflict of both instinctively recoiling from anything that seems like the standard Sage Template and also -- wanting a small selection of what’s in that template, at least so far as her relationship with Link goes.</li>
        <li>I think I have several chapters worth of space to communicate this, but the sooner it’s communicated the happier I’ll be.</li>
    </ol> </li>
    <li>And then for the same logistical reasons of Link’s problems being time-sensetive and taking focus this chapter, and Irene worrying for him, <em>I’m</em> worried that I’ve set the reader up to react and read her in exacly the way that she’s worried about the fictional people of Hyrule perceiving her.
    <li>Actually, now I’m wondering if I’ve written the second chapter first by accident -- would moving this to a hypothetical ch. 2 solve these problems above, assuming these problems exist?</li>
</ul>

<h4>Link</h4>
<ul>
    <li>My goal in characterization is &ldquo;this is an outdoor cat put into a human body&rdquo; In text Irene wonders if he’s lost his sense of urgency around danger; the actual answer is I think he just has the Cat Hubris. How am I doing on that goal?</li>
    <li>Relatedly, am I effectively communicating non-chalance because of the Cat Hubris for him, or does he read as oddly passive here?</li>
    <li>One big caveat to the cat analogy: I think he has a drive to be useful and helpful in a way that is distinctly un-cattish, and isn’t entirely a good thing. Now that I write it out -- it reminds me a little of Rukia’s fear of delegating in the early parts of Audiophile. Part of that is the Cat Hubris again, of course he can handle all these additional tasks, he can do anything. But I also think that there’s more to it, and I worry having the caveat grounded as part of the first chapter completely overwhelms the more direct cattish-ness I want to establish.</li>
