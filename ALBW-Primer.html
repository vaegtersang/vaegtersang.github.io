<!-- l. 4 --><p class='noindent'>The central conceit of the series is that there’s a country, Hyrule, ruled wisely and
benevolently by a monarch (often the eponymous Princess Zelda, though
equally often she has not yet acceded to the throne) but beset suddenly
by some supernatural villain whom you, as the green guy Link, have to go
vanquish. This happens again and again over generations with each game
representing an iteration in the same cycle of re-incarnation. There are also several
goddesses and fewer gods driving the reincarnation part, but for all their
machinations they have basically imperceptible impact on the actual story
of any game and – in complete honesty – the games’ efforts at theological
lore are among their weaker points, and aren’t going to figure largely in the
fic.
</p><!-- l. 6 --><p class='indent'>   <span class='cmti-10'>A Link Between Worlds </span>takes place quite late in the series’s chronology, with
many past Links, Zeldas, and villains looming over the narrative, and though I’m not
much for overgrown theology, I’m very interested in what it means to have that
hypertrophied sense of history hanging over the characters. Given that, it would
make sense for this to be a story largely about Link and Zelda, but alas I make sense
practically never and have gone and made a story that – although it puts ALBW
Link in a respectable amount of mortal peril – is mostly about the travails of a
relatively minor character.
</p><!-- l. 8 --><p class='indent'>   Irene is an ambitious witch-in-training, apprenticed to her grandmother, and
significant to the logic of the game for two reasons: at a game mechanical
level she lends Link the ability to fast-travel between points on the game
map by offering him a lift on her broomstick. And narratively, though she
doesn’t know it, she’s relevant to the plot as the descendant of one of seven
long family lines of people -- sages, is the game's term though they don't seem very sagacious -- who are, jointly, destined to aide the hero by
providing Link access to the land’s most powerful magic artifact. The only
other canonical detail that you really need to know – and that only toward
the end of this first chapter – is that, in <span class='cmti-10'>ALBW</span>, there’s also travel to a
mirror world, where you find everyone you’ve already met in game has a
counterpart who is remarkably similar but, in some important way, their
opposite.
