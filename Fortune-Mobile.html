from her work, bit her lip, and glowered at the myriad suns and distant galaxies
scattered across the black. If there were portents in the stars – and she was most
certainly not conceding that there were – Irene wanted nothing to do with them. The
very premise had something insulting in it. Reading palms or tea leaves, their
subjects as rough and varied as the lives they predicted, required work and
more than a little art. The charting of stars required a few pages of records
and maybe an hour of computation. Irene could change lead into gold, or a
bead into a bandicoot, but not a life into arithmetic, and whatever sense of
professionalism might keep a better witch from crowing at an astrologer’s failures,
Irene lacked it – and it was far too late to worry about professionalism,
anyway.
</p><!-- l. 24 --><p class='indent'>   “Net pull is weak, two or three–” the astrologer mumbled. Irene hadn’t a clue
what two or three was measured in, but he seemed to be talking for his own sake at
the moment “– and it’s…five degrees, no ten toward… um…”
</p><!-- l. 26 --><p class='indent'>   A turtle glid serenely through the cosmos, before coming to an amenably smooth
rock at the end of the visible universe and climbing half-way out. Behind it trailed a
rippling wake that washed the million points of light from visibility; Irene
beamed.
</p><!-- l. 28 --><p class='indent'>   “Interference!” Link whined, “this go doesn’t count."
</p><!-- l. 30 --><p class='indent'>   “Does so."
</p><!-- l. 32 --><p class='indent'>   “Oh come on. I can’t finish the stars now until the pond settles, and you’re still
reading my palm" She wasn’t; she was too giddy.
</p><!-- l. 34 --><p class='indent'>   “If you don’t like it you’re always free to use the actual thing,” Irene said,
motioning upwards to the night sky above them, boxed in by the courtyard’s walls
and occluded by clouds, none of which appeared in the water below them. “I’m
already giving you a leg up, you know.”
</p><!-- l. 36 --><p class='indent'>   “But–”
</p><!-- l. 38 --><p class='indent'>   Irene scooped water from the enchanted pool with her free hand and
flicked.
                                                                  
                                                                  
</p><!-- l. 40 --><p class='indent'>   “Okay! Okay! Fine,” he said in a voice clearly indicating he was anything but, and
indeed might die at any moment, but whatever his pains he recovered quickly “there
really <span class='ec-lmri-10'>is </span>a reading to take from the clouds. They filter the stars’ influence, so
depending which are covered right now…” and back he went to mathematical
muttering. Which stars were covered seemed like an open and closed case to Irene’s
eyes, clouds evenly smothered the whole of the sky, and after the incident with the
turtle, all that was left to light the yard were a set of torches sconced in the
castle walls and the glow of an acorn that Irene had enchanted earlier for a
reading aide. The latter of these suffused Link’s face, and she could see the
focus in his eyes as he peered intently out into space, his lip twitching in
consternation at meanings she did not credit were there, not really, but he
gawked with such conviction that some part of her wondered if there might be
something to the starry mumbo-jumbo he had dragged back from Labrynna after
all.<span class='footnote-mark'><a href='#fn2x0' id='fn2x0-bk'><sup class='textsuperscript'>2</sup></a></span><a id='x1-1003f2'></a>
That wondering was idle, the better parts snapped. This was a competition and if
star-reading had any foundation it could win fair and square against her preferred
style of divination,
</p><!-- l. 44 --><p class='indent'>   “Stop squirming.”
</p><!-- l. 46 --><p class='indent'>   “I’m not!” And he sent forth a tiny spray of water in revenge, but stilled
all the same. Even with his palm steady, the low light proved a burden,
and Irene had to scoot and shift her seat around him until she was nearly
over his shoulder so that, when she leaned in, she did not cover the hand in
shadow.
</p><!-- l. 48 --><p class='indent'>   Once on her broom she had looked down over Zora’s River and realized the
hills of eastern Hyrule were ancient riverbanks whose river had wandered
off.<span class='footnote-mark'><a href='#fn3x0' id='fn3x0-bk'><sup class='textsuperscript'>3</sup></a></span><a id='x1-1005f3'></a>
Rolling hills curlicued around the ghost of an oxbow, while three miles west the River
ran straight. A bluff overlooked a valley that once must have been part of the Eastern
Palace’s moat, and now the River wended lazily around Hyrule Castle. Where now it
bent west, in some age or other past it bowed east, and so on in a thousand
variations on the same watery journey, always emptying into Lake Hylia. Link’s palm
was like that. What she initially thought was a severely bifrucated Life line, crossed
and pockmarked by occlusions was, in fact scores upon scores of Life lines all run
together. Once realized, it shocked her how easily she picked out her Link from the
tangle, and could trace the line as it turned toward the Mount of Apollo, like all the
hundred others. His Heart line ran deep and clear, which was no surprise to
her,
and like all the others, too, it doubled back up to the Mount of Jupiter before
running a short distance and vanishing somehwere on the pads below his ring
finger.
</p><!-- l. 52 --><p class='indent'>   A thousand meandering variations, all ending in the same place. The flow of time
was cruel, indeed.
</p><!-- l. 54 --><p class='indent'>   “–the brightness of µ-thulan… or the Peninsular Star? I didn’t know it bothered
you.” There was a note of genuine apology in his voice.
</p><!-- l. 56 --><p class='indent'>   “What?” It was only after asking that Irene realized she had flinched, and that
Link thought it was something he’d said. She was going to have to explain, now,
                                                                  
                                                                  
when she had only the vaguest preomonition of what was even wrong – and even if
she did understand, what could say? “Oh, not that. Don’t get me wrong the
Labrynnan names are dry as a <span class='ec-lmri-10'>bone</span>, but– Link, there’s something terrible in your
future.”
</p><!-- l. 58 --><p class='indent'>   “Future in the next few days? Weeks?” he said, handling doom with a calm that,
on reflection, should not have surprised her.
</p><!-- l. 60 --><p class='indent'>   “Further out than that.” She was sure of that much, at least, but what was she
allowed to tell? “…Months?”
</p><!-- l. 62 --><p class='indent'>   Link gave a simple resolute nod, and it perturbed her how much even in
this he seemed to be accepting an assignment. “Then I have both time and
excellent counsel.” It was true, but hearing it somehow made everything
worse.<span class='footnote-mark'><a href='#fn5x0' id='fn5x0-bk'><sup class='textsuperscript'>4</sup></a></span><a id='x1-1009f5'></a>
</p><!-- l. 66 --><p class='indent'>   “However I can, I’ll help.”
</p><!-- l. 68 --><p class='indent'>   The conversation hung silent for a moment before Link mumbled an “anyway”
and turned his head back toward the pool, and it hung on for a moment longer while
Irene processed his reaction.
</p><!-- l. 70 --><p class='indent'>   “You’re <span class='ec-lmri-10'>still </span>on that?” she exclaimed once she realized to where his attenion had
turned “”Now, of all times?”
</p><!-- l. 72 --><p class='indent'>   “Well I promised a fortune reading for one,” he said in that same bewilderingly
calm tone “and this late at night it’s not like there’s an octoball game to
join.”
</p><!-- l. 74 --><p class='indent'>   It had to be at least partially an act, she thought, and pushed away a pang of
hurt that he felt he had to keep the performance going for her. But then again,
how often had she flown in only to find him dodging cuccos when the world
was at stake? Maybe it really was normal – well, normal for him – stress
management.
</p><!-- l. 76 --><p class='indent'>   Maybe, but she’d known the peril to all the world then, too, and this felt different
to her.
</p><!-- l. 78 --><p class='indent'>   He’d could simply have been stewing in heroism too long, she supposed. Gram
had always warned her about the difference between feeling urgency and panic, and
never to lose one when you tamped down the other. But it wasn’t like anyone taught
Link heroics, people told him about old curses in even older temples and then he dove
headlong inside them and everyone breathed easier. Save a country or a village or a
world often enough and maybe mortal peril just stopped registering. That
explanation felt incomplete, though. It wasn’t like there was any shortage
of times he’d rung her to side-step monster encounters. For that matter,
there was no shortage of times he’d rung her after a long battle to get to
a fairy fountain, or just to bum red poition. He’d seemed to understand
urgency perfectly well then. She searched his face as he worked for a clue
to his thoughts, but found only a look of concentration give way to one of
confusion.
</p><!-- l. 80 --><p class='indent'>   “What is it?”
</p><!-- l. 82 --><p class='indent'>   “I can’t get an answer.” He said in a tone take took all joy out of victory. “It’s –
once you’ve got a readings of the stars, you try to project…there’s a part where you
find the tip of a cone, only with this reading there’s no cone at all, and it all just
circles and circles without an answer.”
                                                                  
                                                                  
</p><!-- l. 84 --><p class='indent'>   Her mouth opened briefly, then closed again as she realized she had no clue
what to say. Telling him none of his starry mechanics was real wasn’t any consolation
to him, and pretending she believed it meant believing the intolerable, even if Link
hand’t realized it yet. There was an easy explanation for why Link could not read her
future: she didn’t have one. Not that she feared death, she’d read her own
Head line and knew she had ages. A long life without any further events of
note, however, felt discomfitingly plausible. But that was a problem she
only had if she believed nonsense, and even assuming it were true she – by
definition – had a long and healthy life to address it. Link was the one with the
crisis.
</p><!-- l. 86 --><p class='indent'>   From the north wall echoed the clank of armor on stone; the guards were
changing shifts.
</p><!-- l. 88 --><p class='indent'>   “I know there’s a way to get an answer out, but I don’t think I’m likely to find it
tonight.”
</p><!-- l. 90 --><p class='indent'>   “Rain check?” She asked as she got to her feet, exteding a hand up. He took it
and nodded. “And a lift home?”
</p><!-- l. 92 --><p class='indent'>   “I’m staying at the barracks tonight.”
</p><!-- l. 94 --><p class='indent'>   “Do – alright.” She said and then did not say, because it wasn’t like you could
argue Link out of Royal Duty. “Meet me later in the day then. To discuss your
problem.” <span class='ec-lmri-10'>Euphemisms </span>she sputtered in private disbelief. She was using
euphemisms.
</p><!-- l. 96 --><p class='indent'>   “Why not the day after, instead? I’d rather deal with this on full day’s
rest.”
</p><!-- l. 98 --><p class='indent'>   “Deal!” she said with far more vehemence than she meant to, and kicked off the
ground. In the glowing acorn light below, she saw Link waving goodnight, and saw
the turtle slip back in the water.
</p><!-- l. 101 --><p class='indent'>   <span class='lettrine'><span class='lettrine-letter'><span class='lettrine-A'>A</span></span></span><span class='lettrine-line'>bove the clouds</span> the wind blew too sharp and frore to keep her eyes open. Irene
pulled the brim of her hat far down and retreated into her cloak, relying on
memory to navigate home half-blind. It worked, and in half an hour her
boots touched soggy ground and she stood outside her hut, immiserated and
shivering.
</p><!-- l. 103 --><p class='indent'>   An oil lamp burned in the window, which meant Gram was already asleep – and
also that Gram had come around on upgrading from monster tallow, which Irene had
not been expecting for months yet given how vehemently she’d insisted the smell was
an essential part of a witch hut’s ambiance when Irene last raised the subject. Light –
warm, amber, and stenchless – filtered out across the cottage stoop, and in its glow
something glass shone. The lamp might have been brighter than candles, but not
bright enough to reveal any more as she approached than what she already
had guessed: bottles, six of them, sat neatly arrayed on the first step of the
entrance.
</p><!-- l. 105 --><p class='indent'>   When did he find time to leave them?
</p><!-- l. 107 --><p class='indent'>   Carrying the bottles underarm, she ascended the stairs two at a time before
skidding to a stop at the door. She elbowed the latch up, the door swung
inward, and in a trice she had the bottles spread out over the work table.
Lamplight did plenty up close, and now she could see chuu jelly climbing
                                                                  
                                                                  
the glass, meniscus bowed deep, in one, but not a color she’d seen before.
She swirled it in the glass –less viscuous than she was used to, as well. The
next bottle was double-sealed with an inscription in what was <span class='ec-lmri-10'>probably </span>Old
Labrynnan to keep the poe in. Gram would want to have the first look at
that. Then there were peahat leaves, second flush by the smell of them, who
knows where he’d found that but she could cure every sore throat in Hyrule
for years coming with a batch this plentiful. The bottle after held hairs off
a lynel’s tail, and she hrrmed quietly because truly she wished he hadn’t
risked the trouble of getting them. Then there was a clutch of terrorpin eggs,
not remotely magical but she’d always wanted to try them in stew. And
then–
</p><!-- l. 109 --><p class='indent'>   There was something in the last bottle, but scarcely enough something to see. She
could turn the glass under candle light and in the movement caught a rainbow-colored
shimmer off of whatever was inside, but holding it still revealed nothing more.
Rotating it back and forth the same flash of light ran up and down the center of the
bottle no wider than a hair’s breadth, which gave her at least a hunch to go
on.
</p><!-- l. 111 --><p class='indent'>   The bestiary was on the other table, but its pages were folio-sized and it weighed
like a boulder, and if she ever dropped it Gram would let her have it, so
it was easier to carry the lamp and bottle over to it than move the book.
She waited patiently for her hands and sleeves to dry before touching the
pages, then waited impatiently, and after five minutes muttered a piece of
<span class='ec-lmri-10'>drý-cræft</span><span class='footnote-mark'><a href='#fn6x0' id='fn6x0-bk'><sup class='textsuperscript'>5</sup></a></span><a id='x1-1011f6'></a>
under her breath. Gram turned in her sleep, but did not wake. As quietly as she
could, Irene leafed page by page until she came to the illustration and accompanying
text she was looking for:
</p><!-- l. 114 --><p class='indent'>
     </p><blockquote class='quote'>
     <!-- l. 114 --><p class='noindent'>A phantome that represents a hunger lingering vpon the earth. The
     Pol’s uoice stands two feete of height, but with its eares held tall
     may stretch to four. Being ghostlie, it may eat any food and leave
     the likeness of the meal still on the earth, but any who eat the same
     meal after gaine no nourishment. Its whiskers are extreamlie fine of
     texture, and shine in colours sympathetick to whosoeuer holds them
     ahand. When they are added to a preparation of Metheglyn, after it
     has beene set on the fire but before it has come to froth, the drink
     can cure any maladie; but the whiskers haue power onely if severed
     from a living animal (if any Pol’s uoice may be soe called), which by
     the creature’s great fortitude is alwaies a wearisome and dangerous
     uenture. The Venerable Beedle (liber. iv) says that oft the
     Pol’s uoice and the Poe spring from one soule, which vpon death
     becomes diuided into severall partes, the Pol’s voice being the parte
     of a desirous will, the Poe being the parte of an inueterate malice,
     and further prooves the point by obseruing that ‘Pol’ and ‘Poe’ are
                                                                  
                                                                  
     descended from the Sheikah <span class='ec-lmri-10'>Poi</span>, and that in many lands the two
     names doe signifie the same monster.</p></blockquote>
<!-- l. 115 --><p class='noindent'>Irene carefully removed the stopper, plucked out a strand between two fingers, and,
holding it in front of the lamp, saw the whisker darken until it matched the black of
her cloak. She knew, distantly, this meant she could do worlds of good but the only
thought she could actually form and put to words was that this was just like the lynel
tails. Worse, even, because you could at least kill a Lynel before collecting the
tail. Link was in danger and whatever instinct made people jump to save
themselves, he’d lost it. Which meant that if anyone was saving him, it had to be
her.
</p><!-- l. 117 --><p class='indent'>   She sat and stared at the whisker in her hand for a small eternity.
</p><!-- l. 119 --><p class='indent'>   What would Gram do? Not be caught in this situation in the first place,
because she wouldn’t tell fortunes for a lark. Well, what would Gram advise
another witch to do? Drop dead, because she had no truck with fortune
telling at all. Damn. Then, what would an alternate version of her Gram
who didn’t hate palmistry say? Irene strained her imagination to no avail,
but maybe she didn’t need to imagine. She had never travelled that far
from home before, but if she set out early enough she might even be back
by morning, to say nothing of the other advantages of her rapidly-forming
plan.
</p><!-- l. 121 --><p class='indent'>   Self-respecting witches did not meddle, her Gram had drilled this into Irene at the
earliest age possible. Self-respecting witches did not bless infants with good character
or with the ability to talk to animals. Self-respecting witches did not guarantee good
harvests, nor did they guarantee anything. Self-respecting witches especially did not
try to shape people’s futures; and if a self-respecting witch’s daily reading of chuu
jelly <span class='ec-lmri-10'>did </span>happen to mention some idiot thane destined to become king, she kept it to
herself.<span class='footnote-mark'><a href='#fn7x0' id='fn7x0-bk'><sup class='textsuperscript'>6</sup></a></span><a id='x1-1013f7'></a>
Irene intended to break none of these rules, now or ever, but also knew better than to
hope that Gram, if she ever learned of it, would see the nuances of the present
situation.
</p><!-- l. 124 --><p class='indent'>   She likewise was under no illusions that, when Royal duty next found him and
Link next vanished for weeks into the monster-infested wilds and returned, as he
always did, stuffed impossibly and insufferably full of gossip, word of her visit would
somehow not be among the scores of rumors he gathered like rupees. Nor did she
have any question about the sense in which the rumors would run; a young woman
asking after the fortune of a man her age was even more certainly doomed to
romantic misinterpretation than a princess paying honor to her most favored
knight. It had ever been thus, but now, only a year or two away from her
apprenticeship’s end and setting out as a witch in her own right, it was harder to
endure.
</p><!-- l. 126 --><p class='indent'>   In light of the stubborn facts, Irene had taken no time at all to decide that there
would be no rumors, nor a stern talk from her Gram about pride in her craft, and if
it required traveling a world and a half away, well this was hardly any distance at all
to a good broomstick.
</p><!-- l. 128 --><p class='indent'>   It remained a great deal of distance to a young witch.
</p>
